"A_simple_shell" is a C program that implements a shell interface that accepts user commands and executes each command in a separate process. 
It provides a command prompt, where the user inputs a line of command including cat, cd(change directory), pwd (present working directory),
exit (leave shell), fg (foreground a background job), and jobs (list background jobs). 

"Reservation system" is a reservation system with multiple processes, the processes are independently launchable from the shell. Shared memory is used for creating the inter process communication.

Instructions to compile the files

1)There are two important files namely main.c,clearout.c.

for main.c
-------------------------------
gcc main.c -o main -pthread -lrt

for clearout.c 
-------------------------------
gcc clearout.c -o clearout -pthread -lrt


2)Usage of these files

./main or ./main <filename>
starts the table reservation program


./clearout 
destroys all the named semaphore and shared memory.


These executables can be run in different terminals opened in the same directory.

"file system" is a simple file system (SFS) that can be mounted by the user under a directory in the users machine.
